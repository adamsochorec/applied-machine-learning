# Applied Machine Learning (AML)

## Who?
These projects are based on the notes and experiments I conducted during [Petri Valisu√∂](https://github.com/pevalisuo)'s classes at the [University of Vaasa](https://www.uwasa.fi).

## Why?
The aim of this portfolio is to demonstrate my understanding of machine learning algorithms and their application to real-world problems. It serves as a showcase of my skills, experiments, and problem-solving abilities in the field of machine learning, Python, Numpy and Pandas.

## When?
This portfolio was created during the Winter semester of 2023.

## What?
This portfolio includes various machine learning projects using Python. It covers key topics such as:
- **Introduction to machine learning**
- **Python basics for ML**
- **Data reading, cleaning, and plotting**
- **Preprocessing and feature extraction**
- **Unsupervised machine learning for data exploration**
- **Supervised machine learning**
- **Model evaluation and optimization**

## How?
The projects demonstrate hands-on application of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. The code is implements Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy integrated in upyter Notebooks for each step in the learning process.


## Deployment commands
```bash
poetry run jupyter-book build myfirstbook
poetry run ghp-import -n -p -f notebooks/_build/html
```
